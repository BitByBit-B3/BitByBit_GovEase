\section{Executive Summary}

GovEase represents a comprehensive digital transformation initiative for Sri Lankan government services, providing a unified appointment booking and document management platform. This document outlines the current limitations, underlying assumptions, and strategic roadmap for future enhancements of the system.

The platform successfully demonstrates core functionalities including multi-department service booking, document pre-submission, real-time notifications, and administrative analytics. However, several technical and operational constraints exist that limit its immediate deployment at national scale.

\section{Current System Limitations}

\subsection{Technical Limitations}

\subsubsection{Authentication \& Security}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Single Sign-On Integration}: Currently uses Firebase Authentication only. Real deployment would require integration with existing government identity systems (National Identity Card database, Digital ID initiatives).
    \item \textbf{Multi-factor Authentication}: Basic email/password authentication implemented. Government-grade security requires SMS OTP, biometric verification, or hardware tokens.
    \item \textbf{Role-based Access Control}: Simplified three-tier system (citizen/officer/admin). Real-world deployment needs granular permissions based on department hierarchy and security clearance levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Database \& Storage}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints}: Firebase Firestore has query limitations and pricing implications for large-scale government operations.
    \item \textbf{Data Sovereignty}: Cloud-based storage may not comply with government data residency requirements.
    \item \textbf{Backup \& Recovery}: Limited disaster recovery mechanisms compared to enterprise-grade government systems.
    \item \textbf{Data Integration}: No integration with existing government databases (Population Registry, Tax Records, Criminal Records).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance \& Infrastructure}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Concurrent User Handling}: Current architecture untested for high concurrent loads (10,000+ simultaneous users).
    \item \textbf{Geographic Distribution}: Single region deployment; lacks multi-region redundancy required for national service.
    \item \textbf{Offline Capabilities}: No offline functionality for government offices in remote areas with poor connectivity.
    \item \textbf{API Rate Limiting}: Basic implementation; needs sophisticated throttling for government-scale operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Limitations}

\subsubsection{Service Coverage}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Limited Departments}: Currently covers 4 major departments; Sri Lanka has 100+ government institutions.
    \item \textbf{Service Complexity}: Simplified booking process; real services often require multi-step approvals and cross-department coordination.
    \item \textbf{Document Verification}: Basic file upload; lacks integration with document verification systems or digital signature validation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication \& Notifications}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{SMS Integration}: Email-only notifications; many citizens prefer SMS, especially in rural areas.
    \item \textbf{Language Support}: English-only interface; requires Sinhala and Tamil localization for national deployment.
    \item \textbf{Push Notifications}: No mobile app push notifications implemented.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Payment \& Financial Integration}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Fee Collection}: No payment gateway integration; most government services require fee payment.
    \item \textbf{Receipt Generation}: Basic confirmation system; lacks official receipt generation with government letterhead.
    \item \textbf{Refund Processing}: No refund mechanism for cancelled appointments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operational Limitations}

\subsubsection{Change Management}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Staff Training}: Requires comprehensive training program for government officers across all departments.
    \item \textbf{Digital Literacy}: Many citizens and officers may require digital literacy support.
    \item \textbf{Resistance to Change}: Traditional government processes may face resistance to digital transformation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compliance \& Regulatory}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Data Protection}: Needs compliance with Sri Lankan Data Protection Act and international standards (GDPR for international users).
    \item \textbf{Audit Trails}: Basic logging; requires comprehensive audit trails for government accountability.
    \item \textbf{Legal Framework}: May require legislative changes to enable fully digital government service delivery.
